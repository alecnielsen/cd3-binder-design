# Affinity-Attenuating Mutations for CD3 Binders
#
# Literature-derived mutations that reduce CD3 binding affinity.
# Goal: Generate variants with ~10x and ~100x reduced affinity to
# balance efficacy with reduced cytokine release syndrome (CRS) risk.

# Target affinity ranges
affinity_strategy:
  wild_type_kd_nm: 5-20
  target_10x_weaker_kd_nm: 50-200
  target_100x_weaker_kd_nm: 500-2000
  rationale: >-
    Many clinical bispecifics use CD3 arms with Kd ~50-200 nM.
    Lower affinity reduces CRS while maintaining T-cell engagement
    due to avidity effects when tumor antigen is also bound.

# OKT3/Teplizumab-specific mutations
# IMPORTANT: Positions use IMGT numbering, verified against teplizumab VH via ANARCI
# The code uses ANARCI to map these IMGT positions to sequence indices at runtime

  # CDR-H2 mutations (major binding contribution)
  # CDR-H2 in IMGT is positions 56-65

# General strategies applicable to any CD3 binder
general_strategies:
  alanine_scanning:
    description: >-
      Systematically mutate CDR residues to alanine to identify
      hot spots. Residues with >5x Kd change are binding hot spots.
    priority_positions:
      - CDR-H3 aromatics (F, W, Y)
      - CDR-H2 charged residues (R, K)
      - CDR-L3 aromatics

  conservative_mutations:
    description: >-
      Replace hot spot residues with chemically similar but
      smaller amino acids to reduce binding without disrupting fold.
    examples:
      - "Y→F (remove hydroxyl)"
      - "R→K (reduce side chain)"
      - "W→F (reduce size)"

  framework_back_mutations:
    description: >-
      For humanized antibodies, some framework residues affect
      CDR conformation. Back-mutating to germline may reduce affinity.
    caution: May also affect humanness score
