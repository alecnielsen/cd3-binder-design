# Linker Sequences for Antibody Engineering
#
# Standard linkers for scFv construction and Fc fusions.
# Flexible glycine-serine linkers are most common.

# scFv linkers (connecting VH to VL)
scfv_linkers:
  standard_15aa:
    name: "(G4S)3 - Standard scFv linker"
    sequence: GGGGSGGGGSGGGGS
    length: 15
    flexibility: High
    use_case: Most common scFv linker
    notes: >-
      15 amino acids provides sufficient length for VH-VL or VL-VH
      orientation. Highly flexible, low immunogenicity.

  short_10aa:
    name: "(G4S)2 - Short scFv linker"
    sequence: GGGGSGGGGS
    length: 10
    flexibility: High
    use_case: Compact scFv, may affect binding
    notes: >-
      Shorter linker can constrain VH-VL orientation.
      May affect affinity but reduces size.

  long_20aa:
    name: "(G4S)4 - Long scFv linker"
    sequence: GGGGSGGGGSGGGGSGGGGS
    length: 20
    flexibility: High
    use_case: When standard linker causes steric issues
    notes: >-
      Longer linker provides more flexibility.
      Use if standard linker causes aggregation or poor expression.

  whitlow:
    name: "Whitlow linker"
    sequence: GSTSGSGKPGSGEGSTKG
    length: 18
    flexibility: Medium
    use_case: Alternative to (G4S)n
    notes: >-
      Contains charged residues for solubility.
      May have different immunogenicity profile.

# Fc fusion linkers (connecting domain to Fc or VHH to Fc)
fc_fusion_linkers:
  short_5aa:
    name: "G4S - Short Fc fusion"
    sequence: GGGGS
    length: 5
    flexibility: High
    use_case: Minimal spacing

  standard_10aa:
    name: "(G4S)2 - Standard Fc fusion"
    sequence: GGGGSGGGGS
    length: 10
    flexibility: High
    use_case: Most common for VHH-Fc or scFv-Fc fusions
    notes: Recommended for Morrison format IgG-scFv/VHH

  rigid_helical:
    name: "A(EAAAK)3A - Rigid helical"
    sequence: AEAAAKEAAAKEAAAKA
    length: 17
    flexibility: Low (alpha-helical)
    use_case: When rigid spacing needed
    notes: >-
      Forms alpha helix, maintains fixed distance.
      Use when flexible linker causes issues.

  proline_rich:
    name: "(GGGPP)2 - Semi-rigid"
    sequence: GGGPPGGGPP
    length: 10
    flexibility: Medium
    use_case: Intermediate flexibility
    notes: Proline restricts backbone flexibility

# Hinge-derived linkers
hinge_linkers:
  igg1_upper_hinge:
    name: "IgG1 upper hinge"
    sequence: EPKSCDKTHT
    length: 10
    flexibility: Medium
    contains_cysteine: true
    use_case: Natural antibody spacing
    notes: Contains cysteine for potential disulfide

  igg3_hinge:
    name: "IgG3 hinge (extended)"
    sequence: >-
      ELKTPLGDTTHTCPRCPEPKSCDTPPPCPRCPEPKSCDTPPPCPRCPEPKSCDTPPPCPRCP
    length: 62
    flexibility: High
    use_case: Maximum spacing between Fab and Fc
    notes: Very long, highly flexible

# Bispecific-specific linkers
bispecific_linkers:
  scfv_to_fc:
    description: "Linker for fusing scFv to Fc (asymmetric formats)"
    recommended: "(G4S)2"
    sequence: GGGGSGGGGS

  vhh_to_fc:
    description: "Linker for fusing VHH to Fc (asymmetric formats)"
    recommended: "G4S"
    sequence: GGGGS
    notes: VHH is smaller, may need less linker

  c_terminal_fusion:
    description: "Linker for Morrison format (IgG-scFv/VHH)"
    recommended: "(G4S)2"
    sequence: GGGGSGGGGS
    notes: >-
      Connects CH3 C-terminus to scFv/VHH N-terminus.
      10 aa provides good flexibility without excessive length.
